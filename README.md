# build J installers
#
# release.txt has the J release number as major.minor e.g. 9.5.
#
# build.txt has a dummy build number.
# Any change to it triggers copy build to the jsoftware server.
# The number itself is unimportant, e.g. just increment it for a new build.
#
# Other files need not be changed.
